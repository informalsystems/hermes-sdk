# Introduction

This book provides guide for using Hermes SDK, a next-generation
[IBC](https://www.ibcprotocol.dev/) relayer framework for building high performance
and modular IBC relayers. At its core, Hermes SDK makes
use of [_context-generic programming_](https://contextgeneric.dev/),
a new programming paradigm in Rust, to implement the IBC relayer as highly modular
components that can be customized and reused easily.
